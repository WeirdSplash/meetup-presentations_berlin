With R-Lady **Ciera Martinez** (@CieraReports) from San Francisco we explore biodiversity data and what the world of biodiversity data has to offer. Natural History Museums and Botanical Gardens have been digitizing their collections for over ten years yielding billions of data points culminating in one of the most exciting data resources.

We speak also about how to use R to map fossils of extinct animals.

**Unleashing the power of biodiversity data with data science**
