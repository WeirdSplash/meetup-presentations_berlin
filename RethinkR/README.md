# RethinkR

Here, we would like to share a piece of code and invite you to work with us on it. After a short introduction we are going to have fun coding, learning and playing with R altogether.

If you have any chunk of code that you think that would be perfectly suitable - you are stuck and need a fresh view - get in touch with us here on meetup.


### Scenario 1

The first scenario is a setting where you want to work collaboratively with code. 
Possible points of interest:

- how to deal with changing local paths
- different ways to load packages, import data, describe data
- simulating data
- script vs markdown
- base or dplyr 

Go to: [Scenario1_0_master](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_berlin/blob/master/RethinkR/scenario1_0_master.R) and [Scenario1_1_analysis](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_berlin/blob/master/RethinkR/scenario1_1_analysis.R)


### Scenario 2

The second possible scenario deals with the various ways we can plot data. In [this](https://www.zeit.de/wissen/gesundheit/2017-11/alkoholkonsum-studie-schnaps-wein-bier-beeinflussung-stimmung) graph from an article in a German Newspaper of the moods we associate with different kinds of alcohol

### Playground

in the following markdown we will collect our ideas at the end and see what we came up with
