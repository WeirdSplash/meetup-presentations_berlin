# RethinkR

Here, we would like to share a piece of code and invite you to work with us on it. After a short introduction we are going to spend not more than an hour to have fun coding, learning and playing with R altogether.

If you have any chunk of code that you think that would be perfectly suitable - you are stuck and need a fresh view - get in touch with us here on meetup.
