# Hands-on blogdown - How to create your first blog

Did you always wanted to be one who writes and shares content online in a blog? Our organiser Christin presents a tutorial showing you how to setup your first blog using `Hugo` and `Netifly`.

In the second part of the meetup we would like to code with you altogether, running for the first time a section we call "RethinkR". Here, we would like to share a piece of code on GitHub and invite you to work with us on it. After a short introduction we are going to spend not more than an hour to have fun coding, learning and playing with R altogether.

Please install or update the following packages: `markdown` & `blogdown`.

Instructions for the installation of `Hugo`

is coming...
